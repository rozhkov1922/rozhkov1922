<h3 align="left">About me </h3>

I discovered a passion for data analysis during my scientific work. Possession of skills in python and excel allow me to confirm hypotheses not only in scientific, but also in marketing research. I diligently explore data, apply statistical tools, and use data visualization to demonstrate project findings. I am sure that in our time, marketers and scientists cannot do without an in-depth knowledge of programming. That is why I spend a lot of time learning new scills.

In 2022 I defend PHd thesis in political sciences. My work skills can be seen in scientific papers and commercial projects. In my projects, I study a lot of attention to the social, cultural and political context of the research. Knowledge in the field of philosophy and political science allows me to make interesting hypotheses.

My work experience allows me to conduct comprehensive research. In my projects, I rely on step-by-step analysis with careful study of all the details. The experience of preparing a PHd thesis helped me learn a patient approach to any case :)
